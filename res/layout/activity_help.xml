If you want to perform any action on the plant, click on the specified plant first, then click on one of the four buttons on the below. Water can to water the plant, Scissor to trim off the weeds, gloves to harvest, and fertilizer to nutrient the plant.                                                                                                                          2. Be careful with the star rating of the plant. The stars are representing the quality of the plant. When the rating is decreasing, it means more weeds are growing besides your plant, which is a sign of danger for the plant. You need to prune the weeds with the garden scissors.                                                                                                                      3. Attention: If star rating of a plant gets to zero, you loose the game.                                                   4. Try to water the plant, add fertilizer to it, and prune its weeds in order for the plant to grow.                                                                                                                                                       5. You must pass three growth stages to be able to harvest fruits from your plant.                                6. You can restart or exit from the game anytime you want."
